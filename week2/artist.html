    <p1>Sombr, whose real name is Shane Michael Boose, is a 19-year-old American singer, songwriter, and producer from
        New York City. Known for his introspective blend of alternative pop, indie, and bedroom-pop sounds, he rose to
        fame through TikTok, where songs like “back to friends” and “undressed” went viral. His breakout success led to
        appearances on the Billboard Hot 100 and over a billion streams worldwide. Signed under Warner Records and his
        own imprint, Sombr creates emotionally honest, self-produced music that connects deeply with listeners. His raw
        lyrics and intimate soundscapes capture the struggles of youth, love, and self-discovery.</p1><br>
